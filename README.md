## Purpose
The Television of Babel is simple to understand!
Users can enter the site, and upload videos in any resolution, any scale, of anything, with any audio! It will be uploaded to the site, where on the main page users can press the space bar to load a new video. The new video that loads will be random, you could literally get anything, from a video of a screaming goat, to a selfie-style video of a man riding a skateboard, it's limitless.

Please, take a look, upload a few videos, share with your friends, and enjoy the videos you come across!

## Introduction
The Television of Babel is a website project being developed by **Wintrcat** & **Theo Haines**.
It began as a simple idea on the 13/11/2023, between the hours of 9:00am GMT - 4:00pm GMT.

## Inspiration
It takes inspiration from the Library of Babel, a website that contains many many files, which in itself takes inspiration from a short story by Argentinian author *Jorge Luis Borges* which was published in 1941, conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all books.

However, its works a little differently.
On the library of babel website, it works by generating random 'books', containing 410 pages per book, full of 29 random letters (a-z, commas, periods, spaces). In rare occations these letters can form words, and even sentences, and paragraphs!
Whilst the Television of Babel works by allowing users to upload content, where other users can randomly stumble across it by loading random videos!

You can find the Library of Babel website here:
