2. Click the green 'New issue' button in the top right, to open a new issue.
3. Add a title in the title section, that clearly defines what the issue is, and short and simple.
4. In the description, please include all detail and information you can, including positional information, descriptive information! Ensure you make use of the markdown, allowing you to add images, videos, tables, headings, links, lists, and even horizontal rules to seperate segments.
5. Lastly, click the green 'Submit new issue' button in the bottom right.

By following these steps you can submit an issue, and make it incredibly simple for the developers to review any issues, and provide solutions as quick as possible.
If there's slow response times, please feel free to @ the developers to get their attention, but please do not overping them, one is just enough!
